## 🧠 Abstract

This work presents a high-performance, SPI-based communication interface using a 4-wire configuration implemented on an FPGA. The interface supports variable data width, clock frequency, and custom protocol features, making it suitable for sensor data capture and control systems. Simulations validate behavior under multiple conditions, while real-world testing confirms electrical integrity and timing compliance using oscilloscope probes.
